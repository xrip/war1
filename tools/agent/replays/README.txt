Agent game replays (host script, frame-stamped). Replay:
  cd build/host/run && WAR_FIXED=1 WAR_SCRIPT=../../agent/replays/humanN-win.txt ../BIN --race human --mission N
(add WAR_WINDOW=1 to watch). Expect "campaign result: win at tick T".
Today's build: ../war1 --headless --fixed --script FILE --race R --mission N (orc1, orc5 win).

Binaries: the game changes, so a replay plays out only on the build it was made with.
  war1-host (here): human1..5 wins, as recorded (2026-11-05 builds before the attack-button fix).
  build/host/war1-fix2 and later: human1, human4, human5 still win (same ticks for 5);
    human2 differs (its one ground attack now attack-moves), human3 differs (the agent's
    "sel" no longer takes a peasant inside a mine or hall, as a real player can't).

    human6-try*.txt). Plan: hold the base with the army at 42,47, 10 peasants on the 43,44 mine,
